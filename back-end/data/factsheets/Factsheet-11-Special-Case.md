***Small-scale home digester***

Within Europe, the typical size of a biogas plants has an installed capacity of between some hundreds and some thousands kW<sub>el</sub><sup>i</sup>. In Europe, small-scale plants are usually defined as smaller than 100 kW<sub>el</sub>.  A completely different type of biogas plants are **small-scale digesters**, sometimes named as “household biogas system” or “domestic biogas”.

The digester size and gas storage are only a few square meters small. The technology is very simple and basic. Household biogas plants are usually installed close to husbandry or the household and can be installed even on the roof of buildings. In some regions in the world like **Africa, South and Central America and Asia, millions of domestic biogas systems are installed.**

As the regions, where those biogas plants are usually installed have a warmer climate than most of Europe, these biogas plants are not insulated and **run on psychrophilic temperature conditions** (ambient air and soil temperature, 5°C-20°C).

There are some **important reasons and benefits** for their owners. Home Biogas Systems offer:

 - Biogas for cooking and lightning
 - Digestate for better nutrition of plants
 - Low investment costs
 - Mostly based on farm fertilizer and organic waste from households
