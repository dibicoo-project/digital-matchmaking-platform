Biogas is usually produced in a continuous process. However, the use of biogas in applications such as **gas engines, boilers or upgrading facilities** sometimes needs to be throttled or even interrupted (due to maintenance operations, less demand etc.). Therefore, biogas storage systems are **needed to balance biogas production and use.**

Nearly all temporary storage systems work at very **low-pressure levels (several millibars)** with membrane systems. These membranes can be directly installed on top of the digester as single or double membrane or in separate membrane storage systems or tanks from the digester.

The **usual storage capacity** is 3 to 6 hours of the produced biogas amount. Technically, it is possible to install bigger storage capacities, but this will increase the costs.

If the biogas needs to be stored for a longer period than a few hours or if it is applied as transport fuel, then also pressurized steel cylinders could be a choice. These systems are usually installed when higher pressure is needed in the subsequent application. E.g. for the use as transport fuel where **pressure above 200 bars is required**. Usually these storage tanks are made from steel. As impurities like moisture or hydrogen sulfide could cause corrosion, it is important that biogas will be cleaned and dried before it is stored in steel cylinders.
