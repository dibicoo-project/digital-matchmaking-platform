***Treatment, Combination and Upgrading***

<ins>**GHG mitigation potential**</ins>

Biogas is a valuable renewable energy source which offers a **high potential to mitigate greenhouse gas** (GHG) through digesting different kinds of organic material.
In order to fight the climate change, GHG emissions need to be reduced drastically as also agreed in the Paris Agreement. Achieving this goal requires tremendous efforts from all sectors that emit greenhouse gases. In agriculture the storage of excrements from husbandry is a predominant source of GHG emissions, but on the other side also a **major source to produce renewable energy** via anaerobic digestion as the following figures show.

Following the biogas production process, the GHG mitigation potential of AD originates from many pathways. Below are only a few of them described. Biogas is not only a major source of renewable energy. It is also a **very secure and versatile applicable renewable energy form**.

It can be used for:

 - Heating and cooking
 - Combined heat and power production (CHP)
 - Fuel for the transport system
 - Gas grid injection (with all application opportunities listed above)

<ins>**Application via Combined Heat & Power (CHP)**</ins>

As the main energy component of biogas is renewable methane, biogas can also be upgraded to nearly pure **biomethane**. Upgrading unites increase the methane content of biogas up to 90-99% through the removal of mainly CO2 and separate other biogas components (manly water and sulphur) so that it fulfills the combustion and chemical requirements for injection into local public natural gas grids.
