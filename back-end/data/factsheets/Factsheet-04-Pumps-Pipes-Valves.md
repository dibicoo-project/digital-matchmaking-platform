***Transportation of liquids and digestate***

<ins>**Pumps**</ins>
Pumps, pipes and valves are needed to transport liquid substrate, digestate and other liquid substances. 
Depending on specific requirements, such as on the needed pressure, pumping capacity or resistance to impurities, the most commonly used pumps are:

 - rotary pumps
 - rotary piston pumps
 - eccentric screw pump
 - piston pumps
 - membrane pumps
 - peristaltic pumps

<ins>**Pipes**</ins>
Pipes for transporting liquids are usually made of different kinds of plastic, steel or even stainless steel, depending on the pressure and temperature of the liquids transported. The diameter of the pipes used in biogas plants differs significantly from known requirements of water-pipes, as water has a different level of viscosity and no impurities.

<ins>**Valves**</ins>
Valves are installed to control the flow of liquids within the different facilities of the biogas plant: from the feeding system to the digester, between digesters, the pumping station, to the digestate filling station, etc. The installation of double valves is sometimes requested for safety reasons to ensure that if there is a leakage caused by the main valve, it can be stopped by closing the second valve. Slide valves made of stainless steel are the most commonly used to ensure durability.
