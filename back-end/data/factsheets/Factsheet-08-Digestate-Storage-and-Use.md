***Properties, benefits, storage and use***


Besides the biogas, the second valuable product of anaerobic digestion (AD) is the digestate. It contains nondegradable carbon and nearly all nutrients. This turns digestate into a valuable organic full compound fertilizer which can naturally improve soil quality and brings carbon and nutrients back the soil.  herefore, it is usually stored in large tanks until it is needed for plant nutrition. The storage capacity can be up to several months. 

<ins>**Properties and ingredients of digestate**</ins>

The application of digestate for fertilization is usually done with a **slurry tanker**. In some cases, additional equipment, such as trailing hoses or slit injection, is used to incorporate the digestate into the ground and to avoid unwanted emissions of nitrogen. Different technology solutions are being
developed to **upgrade digestate and obtain a more concentrated organic fertilizer**, which is easier to store, and which can be economically transported over longer distances.

<ins>**Benefits of digestate as organic fertilizer:**</ins>

For the plant operator and for appliers of digestate, the **effect on soil microbes and aggregate stability is of high importance**. In order to understand the different impact on soil microbes etc. by digestate and by untreated raw farm fertilizer, a closer look into the digestion process is needed. Besides **degrading carbon and building up biogas** from it, microbes also degrade unwanted volatile organic compounds (e.g. iso-butonic acid, butonic acid, isovaleric acid and valeric acid, along with at least 80 other compounds). If untreated, the latter would cause an unpleasant odour when released to the atmosphere and would also have a negative impact on the soil microorganism.

<ins>**Digestate storage and application techique**</ins>

As digestate is a valuable organic fertilizer, **it should be applied in periods of plant growth**. Depending on the climate conditions where the biogas plant is
constructed, this might require that digestate is **stored over longer periods** when application would not bring benefits for plant growth or would even pollute the environment (e.g. during winter season).
