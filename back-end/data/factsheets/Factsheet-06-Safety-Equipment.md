***Measurement and personal safety equipment***

<ins>**Measurement equipment**</ins>

The safety equipment helps to prevent damages of devices and accidents within the biogas plant.
It can be divided into: 

<ins>Permanently installed devices:</ins>
	
- Control systems
- Over and under pressure devices
- Gas flare
- Gas warning devices

 <ins>Mobile devices:</ins>
- Gas detector
- Non sparks generating cloths
- Non sparks generating tools

The permanently installed devices of the **MCR (measurement, control and regulation) system** shall guarantee that **no over or under pressure** will occur within the airtight system. However, it can happen that over pressure still occurs, then a flare burns the excess biogas. Only in emergency situations (gas usage application and flare are not working) an over pressure valve opens in order to **avoid damages to the biogas plant**.

<ins>**Personal safety equipment**</ins>

**Special gas warning devices** need to be installed in rooms where biogas could occur (e.g. due to leakages in the gas system). These devices are connected to the MCR which start automatically with the following safety measures (depending on the safety regulations of the country):
When gas warning devices detects gas that exceeds <ins>more than 20 % of the lower explosion limit</ins>: The **ventilation of the room starts automatically**, and a gas warning signal will be sent to the operator.
When gas warning devices detect gas that exceeds <ins>more than 40 % of the lower explosion limit</ins>:

 - The MCR will automatically close valves outside of the room, all devices within the room will be shut down and the room will be cut from electricity supply;
 - 	All air blowers to ventilate the room will air the room at full capacity;
 - A gas warning signal will be sent to the operator;
 - Special requirements for entering the room are requested.

Specific **handheld devices** are used to check areas where biogas could occur. If work needs to be done in those areas, special non spark generating clothing and tools are required.
