***Biological process, process conditions, hydraulic flow***

**Anaerobic digestion**
Nature produces and decomposes organic material in an endless lifecycle. The decomposition of biomass happens by abiotic and biotic factors, such as by different microbes which convert the carbon and nutrients of the biomass into new substances. If the biotic degradation process takes place at the presence of air, it is called composting which releases nutrients and carbon. If the **process takes place without the presence of oxygen (anaerobic conditions)**, it is called anaerobic digestion. This process naturally takes place in moors and other swampy regions.

The controlled anaerobic digestion process in a biogas plant provides **two valuable products: digestate**, which contains of all nutrients and remaining carbon, and **biogas**, which is a highly caloric renewable gas. Biogas can be directly used in gas stoves and boilers to produce heat, in gas engines or combined heat and power units (CHP) producing electricity and heat, or it can be upgraded to biomethane. Renewable methane from biogas is chemically identical to methane within natural gas and therefore a renewable natural gas substitute.

**The digester**
In order to facilitate a fast anaerobic digesting process, a **waterproof, gas tight and insolated tank**, the digester, is needed. It provides best conditions for microbes degrading organic matter, namely:
 
 - Absence of oxygen – anaerobic conditions
 - Presence of moisture
 - Warmth – temperature up to over 60 °C
 - Darkness

In praxis, there are many kinds of digesters available. All microbes need water for degrading organic matter into digestate and biogas. Thus, the process in all digesters is a wet process.

**Wet or dry fermentation**
However, depending on the digester design and if the feedstock material is liquid or comparably dry<sup>1</sup>, the biogas technologies are commonly divided into:
 - wet digestion systems
 - dry digestion systems 

**The hydraulic flow**
A second differentiation can be done between: 

 - batch digestion systems
 - continuous digestion systems

In a batch system all organic material is filled into the digester at once and stays there until the degrading process is finished, while in a continuous digestion system digester new organic material is added to the digester each day.
