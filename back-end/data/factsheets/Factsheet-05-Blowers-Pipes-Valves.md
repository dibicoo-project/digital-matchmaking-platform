***Gas flow and transportation of biogas***

<ins>**Gas pipes**</ins>

The produced biogas needs to be transported in airtight pipes. As raw biogas is usually saturated with water vapor and includes, depending on digested feedstocks, hydrogen sulfide, the pipes need to be resistant against corrosion. In addition, they must be resistant against pressure, heat and, if installed aboveground, against fire and UV radiation. Hence, they are usually made of different kinds of plastic and stainless steel.

<ins>**Blowers**</ins>

Blowers are required to pressurize biogas before it is used in a CHP unit (Combined Heat and Power) or biogas upgrading systems. Also, for the injection of biomethane into the natural gas grid, or for the operation of a gas flare (besides a few ones), blowers are needed.
If double membrane gas storage systems are installed, these systems also need a blower to sharpening the upper membrane.

Depending on the needed flow and pressure, usually following types of blowers are used:

 - Radial fan
 - Piston compressor
 - Screw compressor

<ins>**Valves**</ins>

Valves are used in gas systems to steer the gas flow within pipes. They can also be used as a security device in order to detach, for example, the digester and especially the CHP units from the gas system, if required. For the latter the valves are connected to the MCR (measurement, control and regulation) system and are automatically steered. Over- and under pressure valves are installed in biogas plants to prevent the damage of the digesters and other devices in over or under pressure conditions.
