***Receipt, storage, pretreatment and handling of feedstocks***

**Biogas plants usually receive feedstock from different suppliers in the surrounding area.** As each supplier may deliver different qualities and quantities of feedstock the following measures need to be taken:

 - Registration of the charge
 - Quantitative and qualitative detection
 - Taking retain samples
 - Pre-treatment
 - Optional technical pre-treatment processes, such as sanitation and hydrolysis
 - Storage 

Each delivered charge from external feedstock suppliers must be checked to
guarantee that only suitable feedstock gets into the digestion process.

<ins>***Typical feedstock***</ins>

 - **Agricultural residues** which accrue in huge amounts during the harvesting season are usually seasonally stored and fed into the digester by following means:   
	 - **dry and not sensitive to self-decomposition**, it can be first stacked in halls, then transported with a **wheel loader**.
	 - **wet and sensitive for decomposition**, it is most common to store the feedstock in vertical or horizontal airtight silos, transported automatically via auger, conveyor belt, press piston, or with wheel loaders.
	 - **liquid and not sensitive to self-decomposition**, it can be stored in tanks and fed into digester with a pump.

 - **Animal by-products**, like manure, dung or urine are usually feed daily into the digester.
	 - If wet, like liquid manure, it can be pumped.
	 - If dry, like a mixture of dung and straw, it can be transported by wheel loader or other technologies.

 - **Organic waste**

Besides organic waste from food, feed and beverage industries, all other organic waste materials may contain several **impurities which need to be
removed** and then, if containing animal byproducts, the material needs to be sanitized in order to prevent hygienic problems. The additional handling and pre-treatment depend on its origin and characteristics.

Organic wastes from **households** are usually collected source-separated (with a dedicated bin for organic waste) and are constantly delivered.

Organic wastes from **supermarkets (expired food)** needs to be unpacked. Unpacking, removal of impurities and crushing is usually done in one step.
Organic wastes from catering services needs a removal step of impurities and a crushing step.

Organic wastes from **food, feed and beverage processing industries** (e.g. from sugar mills, palm oil mills, breweries, dairies, slaughterhouses) can have very different characteristics and the feedstock handling needs to be adjusted to its characteristics.
